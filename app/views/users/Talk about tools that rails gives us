Talk about tools that rails gives us

helpers, history of how it's doing what it does

revisit the blog application that was

Let's start with ajaxifying a delete button.

Rails provides us with tools. There are ajax helpers. There's a good refernce on edgeguides.rubyonraiils.org/working with javasctipt_in_rails.html.

add into a form_for, :remote => true
add require jquery and jquery_ujs to the manifest

//=require jquery
//=require jquery_ujs

$(function() {
  $("form[data-remote=true]").on(ajax:sucess", funtion(e) {
  var listItem = $(e.target).closest("li");
  listItem
  })

}


*********now need to custom tailor our controller to handle the return in the post controller

rails gives us the ability to handle the kind of request

def destroy
  @post.destroy
  respond_to do |format|
    format.js do
      render nothing: true
    end
    format.any do
    redirect_to posts_path
    end
  end
end

**************************

sweet little rails short cut for a button

<%= button_to "Delete Post", post, :method => :delete, :remote => true %>

***********

really want a link for a delete, can only do that with javascript, and so just change button_to to link_to
